=====================================
Page 1 (questions 1-15)

1. how does the THROW keyword work?
2. in the below code snippet the DoWork() method must no throw any exceptions when converting
the obj object to the IDataContainer interface or when accessing the Data property

which choice should we use?:
A. var dataContainer = (IDataContainer)obj;
B. dynamic dataContainer = obj;
C. var dataContainer = obj is IDataContainer;
D. var dataContainer = obj as IDataContainer;

Answer: D --> "as" the as operator is like a cast operation. However if the conversion isnt possible, as
returns null instead of rasing an exception
